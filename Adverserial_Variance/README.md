### Metric Learninig
Many approaches in machine learning require a measure of distance between data points. However, when using traditional methods it is often difficult to design metrics that are well-suited to the particular data and task of interest.

Distance metric learning (or simply, metric learning) aims at automatically constructing task-specific distance metrics from (weakly) supervised data, in a machine learning manner. The learned distance metric can then be used to perform various tasks (e.g., k-NN classification, clustering, information retrieval).

It means learning a distance in a low dimensional space(non-input space) such that similar images in the input space result in similar representation(low distance) and dissimilar images result in varied representation(high distance).
